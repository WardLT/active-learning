# Active Learning for Python

This is a toolkit for active learning in python designed to be used in conjunction 
with scikit-learn models.  Its structure comes from Roman Garnett's active learning [toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/rmgarnett/active_learning).

## Installation

You can install by cloning with `git clone https://github.com/theodore-ando/active-learning` followed
by `pip install -e ./active-learning`

## Basic usage

See [example.ipynb](example.ipynb) for the basic usage of the API and a simple comparison of some query strategies.
[example_live.ipynb](example_live.ipynb) shows how easy it is to integrate a real person into the labeling loop. 

## Advanced Usage

In the works.
